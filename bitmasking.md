# missing point
[https://www.codechef.com/problems/PTMSSNG]

we notice that for rectangles to exist and one point missing
then on x axis all points are in even numbers except one point which is missing
same goes for y axis ...
so we just need to find out which number is odd in x and y axis
we can use map for it but
we can also use property of xor

ex : x : 1 1 1 1 [1] 2 2 2 2 ===> 1
